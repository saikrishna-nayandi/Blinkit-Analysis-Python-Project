## 📈 Insights Generated

### 🔹 High Sales Correlation with Item Type and Fat Content  
Items with higher fat content (e.g., Full Cream, Whole Milk) showed significantly **higher total sales**, suggesting strong customer preference for richer food products.

### 🔹 Top Performing Item Types  
Certain item categories such as **snacks**, **dairy**, and **beverages** consistently outperformed others, both in terms of **sales volume and revenue**. This insight can be used for **inventory prioritization**.

### 🔹 Outlet Type vs Sales Performance  
Modern and supermarket outlet types outperformed others, with **higher average sales per outlet**. Traditional outlets showed relatively low performance, which might indicate a need for **targeted marketing or operational support**.

### 🔹 Outlet Establishment Year Impact  
Outlets established more recently (**post-2015**) displayed **faster growth in total sales**, while older outlets had **stable but lower growth**. This may reflect newer infrastructure or more effective service models.

### 🔹 Outlet Size and Location Effect  
- **Medium-sized outlets** had the best balance between **footfall and operational cost**, showing **higher sales efficiency per square foot**.  
- **Urban locations** significantly outperformed suburban or tier-2 outlets, indicating potential for **expansion in metropolitan regions**.

Products with an **average rating above 4.2** not only sold more but also had **higher repeat purchase rates**. This suggests a strong correlation between **product quality, satisfaction, and revenue**.

### 🔹 Inventory Optimization Opportunities  
Some items with **low ratings and high returns** had unexpectedly **high stock levels**, indicating a mismatch between **demand and inventory**. Optimizing stock based on performance could reduce **holding costs**.

### 🔹 Underperforming Categories and Locations  
Certain item types (e.g., **frozen foods**) and specific outlet locations consistently **underperformed** in both **sales and ratings**, suggesting a need to **reassess product offerings and marketing strategies** in those areas.
